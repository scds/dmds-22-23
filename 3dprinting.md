# 3D Modelling and Printing

This was a day-long workshop that explored 3d modelling and printing. The group took a physical object from the real world, used a series of sophisticated software to render it into a 3d model, and then learned how to print that model on a 3d printer.

Presentation by John Fink, Digital Scholarship Librarian, and Britt Sostar, Thode Makerspace Coordinator.
