# Open Everything! A Panel on the Whats, Hows, and Ifs of Open Scholarship

The shift towards 'openness' has been undeniable and accelerating within the academic landscape over the past decade. From open-source software, to open data, methods, and identifiers, to open access publishing and educational resources, more and more of the scholarly ecosystem can be discovered, reused, remixed, and connected in novel ways.
