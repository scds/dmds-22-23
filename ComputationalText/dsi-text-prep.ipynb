    "# Lesson: Basic text prep with Python\n",
    "by Alex Provo and Jay Brodeur for [ARL DSI 2021](https://jasonbrodeur.github.io/dsi-text-prep/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll run through a few examples that introduce you to text exploration, manipulation, and transformation using Python. The purpose of these exercises is to familiarize you with basic concepts of preparing text in Python, and hopefully, encourage you to explore it a bit more. \n",
    "  \n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we've tried to document as much as possible the operations that we're performing, and the motivations behind doing so. More than anything, we're trying to convey the exploratory and often iterative nature of developing scripts and functions to prepare text for further analysis.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Towards the end, we'll demonstrate some of the interesting things you can do with Natural Language Processing (NLP) packages like [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). There are **many** more tools and resources to explore, and we've listed some of them in the [Learn More](https://jasonbrodeur.github.io/dsi-text-prep/learn-more.html) page of the workshop website. \n",
