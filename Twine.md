## Intro to Twine Games

<img src="assets/img/TitleSlide.png" alt="Workshop Title Slide" width="720">

Twine is a beginner-friendly platform for building Choose Your Own Adventure Games. Follow along with the four tutorial videos below to get started with Twine. All videos use the Harlowe 3.3.4 story format. 

These tutorials were made for HUM2DH3: Creative, Collaborative, Critical: Introduction to Digital Scholarship. Sections of the videos relate directly to an assignment where students create a retelling of Frankenstein through a Twine Game. However, the majority of each video functions as a general introduction to Twine Games. 

Asynchronous Tutorials by Veronica Litt, Digital Scholarship Coordinator.
