## Computational Approaches to Text Preparation and Analysis

<img src="assets/img/ComputationalText.png" alt="Workshop Title Slide" width="720">

Are you interested in textual analysis but unsure about where to start? Join us for an interactive “no experience required” introduction to the fundamental concepts, processes, and methodological approaches for preparing and analyzing text using computational approaches. Following a general introduction to the topic, participants will be guided through prepared exercises that demonstrate how different software packages (OpenRefine, Python) can be used to prepare for and perform textual analysis.

Presented by Jay Brodeur (Associate Director, Digital Scholarship Infrastructure & Services and Administrative Director of the Sherman Centre for Digital Scholarship) and Devon Mordell (Educational Developer, The MacPherson Institute for Teaching and Learning).

## Preparation

For this workshop, you will need [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) and a web browser. Follow the [instructions](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-open-refine/setup.html) provided by the Library Carpentry to install OpenRefine on your system (whether it is Windows, Mac, or Linux).
- **NOTE**: When opening OpenRefine for the first time in a Mac, you may need to open your security preferences and permit OpenRefine to run. See [Apple Support's Open a Mac app from an unidentified developer](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac)
