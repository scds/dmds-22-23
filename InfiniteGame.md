## The Infinite Game: ChatGPT, Procedural Generation, and Large Language Models

<img src="assets/img/IGP.png" alt="Workshop Title Slide" width="720">

Since launching in late 2022, ChatGPT has sparked an ongoing, complex conversation about large language models and artificial intelligence. But where does this cutting-edge technology come from? What are its roots--and how can they help us understand today's software?

This webinar by John Fink (Digital Scholarship Librarian) explores the history of procedural generation in text and games, from the I-Ching to ChatGPT and beyond. The talk will emphasize current state of the art Large Language Models like ChatGPT, including a demonstration on how to run one on a modest computer and get near-ChatGPT quality output.
